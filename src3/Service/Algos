- can combine it with strategy pattern to decide which algorithm to use to
solve / generate the maze:
    dijkstra
    A*
    recursive backtracking
    dead-end filling
    right hand side
    ...

- (possible) implement a factory pattern to create different strategies
- (possible) implement observer to have multiple mazes all connected /
2 mazes: one for the solution ( to give out hints ) and one for the player

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ improved maze generation
+ implement a solver class made for the user( read input from keyboard )
    implement option that lets you backup( implement checkpoints )
